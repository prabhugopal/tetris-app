# SiTE : Simplified Tetris Engine

SiTE is a simplified version of the tetris game engine. This is a console based application, which reads the sequence of shapes as an input to the game engine, and produces the resultant height (in number of rows) from the final state of the game as an output.

Shapes supported by this game engine are represented by letters, the letters used are Q, Z, S, T, I, L, and J. Check the below diagram for the representaion for the shapes currently supported.
